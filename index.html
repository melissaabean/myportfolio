          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>My name is Melissa, I am 25 years old and I am learning how to code! what first intrigued me about coding was the ability to create something from nothing. I decided to learn HTML on my own and I thought it was the coolest
            thing ever, typing something and seeing it on the web page. Then, it triggered me to learn a little CSS to make it look more appealing to the eye. That's when things got a little trickier and code stopped working or it wouldn't 
            do what I wanted it to do, it started to feel like a puzzle I made and was trying to solve... I like puzzles. I decided to take a chance on myself and join UC Berkley extension coding bootcamp.
            I am a fast learner and a very determined person, some will call it stubborness, I like to call it being driven. Outside of the bootcamp, I am a Production Planner/Manufacturing Trainer. I am currently
            preparing for my first bodybuilding show in June - Wellness division, and I love spending time with family.

          <h2>Prework Study Guide</h2>
          <p> One of my first unofficial challenges was creating a webpage for my notes during the pre-work. I learned how to structure HTML, style it using CSS and pushing it to Github. <br>

          <h2>Horiseon Refactor</h2>
            <p>My first challenge was refactoring code on an already up and running website. The challenge itself entailed
              reviewing the code and updating it to make sure the HTML elements followed a logical structure independent of styling and positioning,
              the icons and image elements had accesible alt attributes, the heading elements fell in sequential order, and making sure the title was consice and descriptive. <br>

          <h2>Marvel - Character Information</h2>
            <p>For my firt group project my team and I created a website for Marvel characters. Using the Marvel API and OMDB API, this website will allow them to search key characters and find both 
              the movies and comics that they appear so that they can catch up fully on the Marvel Universe 
              as if they have been watching since day one. <br>
